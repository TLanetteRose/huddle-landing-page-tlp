# Huddle Landing Page with Curved Background Images for Frontend Mentor

![Design Preview for Huddle Landing Page with Curved Background Challenge from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
I completed the Huddle Landing Page with Curved Background Images using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It's a mobile-first design starting with screen-size 375px. I used BEM Guidelines for naming my CSS classes. 

I have added media queries for the following minimum screen widths:
1. 468px -- Phone
2. 600px -- Phone
3. 768px -- Tablet
4. 1024px -- Desktop

The page design uses a curved background image in two feature sections and the footer.
